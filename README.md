# Hangman
This was a simple project I made you can play on your terminal. This hangman project is done fully in python. The purpose
of this project was to get adjusted to python's syntax.

# Future
For the future of this project, I fully intend to add to the pygame library and make a visually appealing gui software of Hangman. 

# How To Use
To play hangman, download the repo and type python hang.py in the terminal. Have fun!
